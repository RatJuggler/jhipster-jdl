# jhipster-jdl

Some examples of JDL schema for use with JHipster.

JDL is the JHipster Domain Language, the specification can be found [here](http://www.jhipster.tech/jdl/).

You can edit JDL files in VS Code or Eclipse using the JHipster plugin or they can be uploaded to [JDL-Studio](https://start.jhipster.tech/jdl-studio/)
where you can edit and view the schema diagram.

Also see notes on the use of DTOs [here](https://www.jhipster.tech/using-dtos/).

*Note:* The ".jh" file extension is used as a default by JDL-Studio but the plugin likes ".jdl".
