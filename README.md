#JHipster-JDL

Some examples of JDL schema for use with JHipster.

JDL is the JHipster Domain Language.

You can edit JDL files with any text editor, or they can be uploaded to [JDL-Studio](https://start.jhipster.tech/jdl-studio/)
where you can edit and view the schema diagram.

The JDL specification can be found [here](http://www.jhipster.tech/jdl/).

*Note:* The ".jh" file extension is used as a default by JDL-Studio.

## Examples

- A blog, as used in Matt Raible's [Getting Started with JHipster 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQqlO3IGpTU) video.

- The default HR system example from the JDL-Studio editor.

- An implementation of the Petclinic entities used in numerous other project examples.

- The entities used in my own [Dinosaurs JHipster](https://github.com/RatJuggler/jhipster-dinosaurs) example.
